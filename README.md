# Passenger Prediction using ARIMA Model

This repository contains a project focused on predicting the number of passengers using an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The project includes data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `PassengerPrediction_ArimaModel.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook provides an in-depth exploration and implementation of the ARIMA model for passenger prediction, including data visualization, model fitting, and forecasting results.
-  `data_passenger.csv`: Study data.
- `PassengerPrediction_ArimaModel.html`: An HTML export of the Jupyter Notebook for easy viewing of the analysis.

## Getting Started

To view the analysis:
1. Open the `PassengerPrediction_ArimaModel.html` file in your web browser for a static view.
2. For an interactive experience, open the `PassengerPrediction_ArimaModel.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/UnlicensedDataScientist/PassengerTrafficPrediction_ARIMA.git
```
